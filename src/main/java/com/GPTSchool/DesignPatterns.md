# Design Patterns Chapter

## Overview

This chapter delves into the world of design patterns in software engineering, providing insights into common patterns used in object-oriented programming. Design patterns offer standardized solutions to frequent issues in software design and architecture.

## Objectives

- Understand the concept and importance of design patterns in software development.
- Explore various types of design patterns: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.
- Implement and analyze key design patterns: Singleton, Observer, and Factory.

## Key Concepts

- **Design Patterns**: Reusable solutions to common software design problems.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Observer Pattern**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
- **Factory Pattern**: Creates an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

## Content Structure

### Singleton Pattern

- **File**: `src/main/java/singleton/Government.java`
- **Concept**: Ensuring a single instance of a class.
- **Example**: A government system where only one government instance is allowed.

### Observer Pattern

- **Files**:
    - `src/main/java/observer/WeatherStation.java`
    - `src/main/java/observer/WeatherStationImpl.java`
    - `src/main/java/observer/NewsAgency.java`
- **Concept**: Implementing a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they are observing.
- **Example**: A weather station broadcasting updates to news agencies.

### Factory Pattern

- **Files**:
    - `src/main/java/factory/Character.java`
    - `src/main/java/factory/Warrior.java`
    - `src/main/java/factory/Archer.java`
    - `src/main/java/factory/Mage.java`
    - `src/main/java/factory/CharacterFactory.java`
- **Concept**: Creating an interface for object creation while allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Example**: A game character creation system where the type of character is decided at runtime.

## Exercises

- Implement the Singleton pattern in a logging system.
- Create an Observer pattern for a stock market update system.
- Develop a Factory pattern for a simple vehicle manufacturing simulator.

## Resources

- "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides.
- Online tutorials and documentation for Java design patterns.
