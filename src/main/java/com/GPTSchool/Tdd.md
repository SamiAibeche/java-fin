# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Chapter

## Overview
Learn the Test-Driven Development approach where tests are written before code. TDD encourages simple designs and confidence in software.

## Objectives
- Grasp TDD fundamentals.
- Write tests before implementation.
- Refactor code with tests as a safety net.

## Key Concepts
- Red-Green-Refactor Cycle: Write a failing test, make it pass, then refactor.
- Writing Testable Code: Create code that's easy to test and adheres to SOLID principles.
- Testing Frameworks: Introduction to JUnit.
