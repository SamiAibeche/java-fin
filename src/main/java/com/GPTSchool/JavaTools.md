# Java Development Tools Overview

This document provides an overview of essential tools for Java development: Maven, Gradle, and Spring Framework, including installation guides and basic project setup examples.

## Maven

### What is Maven?
Apache Maven is a project management tool for Java projects, focusing on building, dependency management, and documentation.

### How to Install Maven
1. **Download**: Visit the [Apache Maven Project](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and download the latest version.
2. **Extract**: Unzip the archive to a directory of your choice.
3. **Environment Variables**:
    - Set `MAVEN_HOME` to your Maven directory.
    - Add Maven’s `bin` directory to the `PATH`.
4. **Verify Installation**: Run `mvn -v` in a terminal.

### Example Project Setup
Create a `pom.xml` file in your project directory:

```xml
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>hello-world</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</project>
```

## Gradle
### What is Gradle?
Gradle is an advanced build automation tool, known for its flexibility and performance, supporting multi-language development.

### How to Install Gradle
1. **Download**: Go to the [Gradle Releases Page](https://gradle.org/releases/) and download the latest version.
2. **Extract**: Unzip to a directory of your choosing.
3. **Environment Variables**:
   1. Set `GRADLE_HOME`.
   2. Add Gradle’s `bin` directory to the `PATH`.
4. **Verify Installation**: Execute `gradle -v` in a terminal.

### Example Project Setup

Create a `build.gradle` file in your project directory:

```
plugins {
    id 'java'
}

group 'com.example'
version '1.0'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.2'
}

```
## Spring Framework
### What is Spring?
Spring is a comprehensive framework for building Java applications, offering infrastructure support and promoting good practices.

### Setting Up Spring Boot
Spring Boot simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications.

1. **Spring Initializr**: Use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to generate a Spring Boot project.
2. **Customize**: Select build tool (Maven/Gradle), language, Spring Boot version, and dependencies.
3. **Generate & Download**: Generate the project and download the zip file.
4. **Import Project**: Extract and import it into your IDE.

### Example Spring Boot Application
After generating a Spring Boot project, you'll have a main application file like:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class HelloWorldApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(HelloWorldApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```
### Using Maven/Gradle with Spring Boot
The generated project includes a Maven pom.xml or a Gradle build.gradle file. These handle Spring Framework and other dependencies.
