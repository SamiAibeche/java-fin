# Java Streams

This document provides an overview of Streams in Java. Streams represent a sequence of elements and support various operations to perform computations on those elements, often in a functional style.

## Overview of Streams

Streams in Java provide a high-level abstraction for processing sequences of elements. Introduced in Java 8, they offer a declarative approach to data manipulation and are particularly useful for working with collections.

## Key Characteristics

- **Not a Data Structure**: Streams do not store elements. They carry values from a source (like collections) through a pipeline of computational steps.
- **Functional in Nature**: Streams operations are mostly lambda expressions executed in a functional style.
- **Lazy Execution**: Stream operations are lazy, meaning computation on the source data is only performed when necessary.

## Stream Operations

Stream operations are divided into intermediate and terminal operations.

- **Intermediate Operations**: Transform the stream into another stream. Examples include `filter`, `map`, and `sorted`.
- **Terminal Operations**: Produce a result or a side-effect. Examples include `forEach`, `collect`, and `reduce`.

## Example of Using Streams

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class StreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);

        // Using streams to filter, map, and collect data
        List<Integer> squaredEvenNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                                  .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                                                  .map(n -> n * n)
                                                  .collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println("Squared Even Numbers: " + squaredEvenNumbers);
    }
}
```
In this example, a list of numbers is processed using a stream. The stream filters out only the even numbers, squares them, and then collects them into a new list.

## Conclusion
Streams in Java are a powerful tool for processing collections and other sequences of data. They allow for expressive, readable, and concise code, especially when dealing with transformations and aggregations.
